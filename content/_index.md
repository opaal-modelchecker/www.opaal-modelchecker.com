opaal is a model checker with the design goals of enabling rapid prototyping, being easy to learn and being sufficiently fast. It should be the first tool used when wanting to try out a model checking concept, therefore it needs to be open source. It should be so easy to learn that a group of undergraduate students can implement something useful with it in one semester. This requires readability, good overview and loose coupling. It should be sufficiently fast, by implementing the low-hanging optimisation fruit - gold plating is forbidden!

The design criteria for opaal is:

1.  Rapid prototyping
2.  Easy to learn
3.  80-20 rule for optimisations

### 1\. Rapid prototyping

Try out concepts quickly  
Before doing more time-consuming, optimised implementation  
Open Source  

### 2\. Easy to learn

A group of 5th semester students should be able to implement  
something in a project  
Readability, overview, loose coupling  

### 3\. Implement the 20% of the optimisations that give 80% of the speedup

No gold plating  
Sufficiently fast  
We learn as we go
